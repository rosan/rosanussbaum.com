<p>  Artists were invited to artist Alejandra López Martínez' house to make a drawing. Then drawings were swapped between artists. We made work in response to eachother's drawings. This is what I made in response to Helen Savage's drawing.

      When we drive I see them slicing - thack thack thack thack. Minty sharp edged rectangles unto the rosy slab of concrete.</br> 
      Stairs on the flattened maps - a strange reference to an otherwise obscure verticality.</br> 
      Num pad 5 for orthographic, 7 for top view - the vertices l collapse.</br>
      On some evenings or in the too bright pre-breakfast; an almost painful tenderness for the thin blue stalk of this y-axis.</br>
       Only for that stillness to ripple in the chop chop chop chopper soundtrack of the aerial view, blades exposing that venn diagram:</br>
      your bedroom contained in your living room, the intersection of your bathroom and your kitchen enclosing less surface area:</br>
      Though maybe just enough to fit your mind in on the way from one to the other.
