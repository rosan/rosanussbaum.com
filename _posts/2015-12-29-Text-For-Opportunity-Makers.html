   So so I had a coffee with Bryony on Wednesday. Bryony had a flat white and banana bread and I had an Americano and an apple. Bryony asked me whether I had noticed the reflections of the light bulbs in the window. I had. We sat in silence for 2 hours. Then Bryony asked: ‘Rosa how did feminist ideas impact the way you ran nice gallery, the nine months artist residency and gallery program you set up in Colliers Wood with the help of a free space and £3,000 grant you got from your university after graduating. 
</p>
<p>
  Later, at a well attended event Bryony expose her vagina. It was a massive crowd pleaser, she said. 
</p>
<p>
  I said to Bryony - it's water under the bridge you know? Like a vessel hollowed-out it flowed through me. 
  What was left? </br>
  Well I was clean and round like a barrel of a gun.

   I don't sleep for 36 hours. An anxious lassitude has come over me and I can't be alone so I call my bird like American friend and he tells me stories about driving for hours and hours through the bright flatness fading into dark and setting the road on fire and breaking his nose. Then the guy in the Picasso sweet knocks and tells me stories about lighting the bench on fire and three stories about breaking his nose and playing knives. This is how you play Knives: Everyone get a knife. 
  Breakfast and then on the train I'm sitting next to the magician who put that nail in his nose yesterday. It's a real nail. There's a duct between your cheek and your skull just under the eye, he explains. Once, he said, we piled up dead Leaves and let the road on fire. My uncle ran over a moose and his car was covered in blood and fur and gristle. This uncle had a gun. He left let me hold it once. It was heavily and it scared me. 
  Rosa? Yes. Quickly (haha), how did Feminist politics influence your intentions? 
  I think about the way his eyes watered, the pained twinge of his mouth as he hammered the nail in inch by inch and I feel like a fraud. I really don't think they did. The whole thing was pretty incoherent and founded more on my desire to play galleries and have a structure after uni. I got really uncomfortable real quick with the power dynamics that having exclusive access to resources created. Not just people I thought I might sometimes be sometime be friends trying to schmooze me, but having an unearned leverage over people I liked and respected. It taught me a lot about how we measure our success as artist and house arbitrary and flawed those accolades can be. I don't know. I have no narrative. It's more just something that happened. Lots of people were involved in.

  When I was 15 I had a boyfriend called Linus. It was light outside and we were lying on his bed. Do you think I am beautiful? I asked. Sometimes, he said. We roll into Paddington and swim through the crowd. Wave after wave breaking over me and I swallow salt water and coffee but try not to show how much I'm struggling. At the ticket barrier a station attendant turns to me. Her dark uniform falls in bold ill-fitting folds over her large bosom. Her feet seem incredibly remote to me and I ache to decrease that distance to touch and hold them. She gently grasps my chin and bring my face to hers. Rosa. How did you find doing it / how did you do it (money / time / labour / enjoyment)?</br>
  I didn't. I stopped.</br>
  Rosa, have you slept?</br>
  I look down.</br>
  It's ok. You’ve read the tyranny of structurelessness now you are becoming more articulate and you're developing a kind of sensibility.I know you didn't feel in control of the construction of the narrative around nice. You'll do a better job next time around.
