  Whittingdale residency group, named after Conservative, UK Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport John Whittingdale. (Conservatives in power â†’ Austerity; cuts to welfare state and arts, rising student fees.)
Whittingdale is an ongoing residency under the Tory government. It is also a peer to peer artist support group or the chance to talk about how hard it is to balance art, money and life. We built a shed/clubhouse called the Whittingdale Pavilion in Sophie's garden as a temporary art space. Embracing the bits about being an artist that we usually try to conceal and spoofing conventional accolades whilst still trying desperately to attain them, Whittingdale is a way of being conscious of the circumstances under which work is produced.
