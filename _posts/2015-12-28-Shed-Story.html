  This is the story about a thing that happened and how the shed was built and why. It is untrue in several important ways.  In this story the dead bird appears twice; once at my grandparents house and once at  B&Q where the man holds it’s plump body by a toothpick leg. I guess I wish you had told me the truth right away. But you will have insisted that the sense of revelation and betrayal is the only way to access the actual content of the events.

I would start with that early evening in Sophie Chapman’s garden; with the ivy and the roses and the fence like a wooden facsimile of my canines and the hole in the back wall that is boarded up but not really.

If you flip the garden up on that side the grass would droop down along the ground like when I wash my hair and it’s heavy and almost straight and almost everything would fall out; the cat, the people, some of my friends pretty much all of the tools and snails and most certainly all of the nails. Not the shed though; it would just slide down and clog up the hole.

But even before I have said all of this, I know that you will have wanted me to start before that. Before the bit about the birds and the cold golden tartness of those late September apples. You will they wanted me to start on the night I met my friend E. at the pub near Earls Court and I was on the phone for 26 minutes in the clean prettily tiled ladies bathroom. They had those purple and powdery green flowers that might be dried or fresh or really good fakes. It was dark outside and my dress was wet from cycling through the deluge. It hasn't been so bad when I set out. But right along that road that runs past the park with those giant fat yellow cable drums, over the bridge that intercept the tenuous vertical communication between the river and sky. The Chop Chop of the uneasy water like silvery white noise reflecting the blander anxiety of the overwrought firmament.

Trying remember, those orange late night time cranes swing heavily through my mind. Are you sure?

I meet Mao Tse-Tung, occupation: revolutionaries statement, at the Cereal Killer Cafe. I'm just having coffee but Mao’s got a bowl of fizzing crackling Coco Pops in front of him.

Mao says:</br>
<em>I was born on December 26, 1893 in Shaoshan village, Hunan Province, China. My father, Mao Yichang, was an impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan. I would go on to describe my father as a stern disciplinarian, who would beat me and my three siblings, the boys Zemin and Zetan, and an adopted girl, Zejian.  My mother, Wen Qimei, was a devout Buddhist who tried to temper her husband's strict attitude.</em>

Quickly he moves his soft full hand over mine. I feel the pressure of his palm, his fingers dry and powdery and then something hard and sharp. He retracts his hand shily. When I look, I see that he has given me this.

So I cycle home in big slurry curves. The world has become unfocused reality pushed to the periphery in the dark. The wet asphalt smells of night, the orange glitter of the street lamps. Tiger tiger burning bright I think and tumble into the ditch like a bag of cotton balls emptied on the bathroom floor I roll around in the thick wet smell of Earth and grass and imagine the tingling feeling I'll have when the mud has dried tickling slightly on the skin of my face and hands as it shrinks and then the pinching of peeling it off; the fine hairs on my body stretching and being released, stretching and snapping. Jamie Oliver is lying next to me in the dirt. Jamie Oliver, I say. Yeah, he says. I reach for his hand and he pulls me to him with his arm so that my head lies on his shoulder. I bury my face in his chest and he smells like man and like television.

By now our clothes are saturated with mud and if the sun rises now we will be baked into clay husks. Jamie has a penknife so we can cut open our rigid chrysalises and step naked into the soft dry heat of the noonday sun.

We walk together on the cracked earth and as we part Jamie Oliver bend over me and smells the crown of my head. It must smell like hair and sun and hangover. He speaks and I feel his lips brush my scalp, his breath moves the hot air. You've got to spend money to make money, he says.

I walk and find Tackwise in the sun on a wall eating an apple. In the past Tackwise has made certain overtures to me but that is hardly relevant here. I have missed you Tackwise, I say. He grins and I climb up next to him, the bricks rough and warm against my bare skin. I saw you the other day at the Cereal Killer Cafe, he says, his hard glossy body arched in anticipation - waiting for my reaction. I didn't see you, I say evenly. He just smiles and we get to work on the floor of the shed. Later Tackwise looks up. Rosa, he says. Yes Tackwise. He pauses for a moment, then: You know what Jamie Oliver said? Yeah. Take it for what it is.

Later on the Tube I sit opposite that bit of wall between the windows and I can't find my reflection.

Earlier, I had to get off my bike for the blue and white flocks in Fulham. I stand among them like a finger in a stream, the feathered fans eddying and rippling around me like a momentarily furrowed brow.

My fingers touch the little skull in my pocket but I feel it would be inappropriate to pull it out now. I think of Tackwise and remember my friend E., her face bathed in the golden light of that pub and she says;
If he does, it will be the end of everything.
